famine-gameJS
=============

JS version of the famine game app!



Notes on running the app:
In Resources/data, there are a few sample data sets. 
* fresh-game-test is an example of a first-time run. 
* mid-game-test1 is an example of a game that is resumed mid-game.
The app runs out of "working." Before running the app, copy the files from one of the above directories to the folder (don't commit once you copy! version in the repo should stay empty.)

							<h3 class="section-name">The Arena Field App</h3>
							<div id="content">
								The Capitol has provided you with this app for use in the Arena.  It will provide you with a means to solve certain challenges, receive news coverage of events in the Arena, and receive messages from your sponsor.
							</div>
						</p>

						<p>
							<h3 class="section-name">Parts of the App</h3>
								Information regarding your team and its status can be found on the left side of the app.  Information regarding other tributes can be found on the bottom.  These two rows of icons represent each team.  Mousing over these icons will show team names while clicking on them will bring up their bio.  Several tabs at the top of the app allow you to navigate between different views.
						</p>

						<p>
							<h3 class="section-name">Views</h3>
								There are three different views in the app, each reached by clicking on the appropriate tab.  These views are:
								<p>
									<h4 class="section-name">Main</h4>
										This is the Main view.  In it you can view important information about your challenges (often referred to as puzzles) and location.  It consists of a central, descriptive panel and an informational panel on the right.  Certain lines in the information panel may have more information that can be viewed by mousing over them.  For example, the panel may say "Parking: Yes".  Mousing over the "Yes" may give you further details regarding the parking situation.  These hoverable links will be bold and in a darker font.<br><br>

										<b>Note: Bold text in the central description panel contains pertinent information, e.g. specific directions to a location.  All other text is purely for flavor.</b><br><br>

										When in the Main view, you can activate a challenge by entering its start code in the lower right hand corner.  Once a challenge is activated, the view will switch to that challenge.  You can always switch back to the original view (the one showing location information) using the links in the navigation bar near the top.  To get back to your challenge, simply click the Return To Current Puzzle button which has replaced the code entry box.<br><br>

										To complete a challenge, simply enter its answer into the answer box.  All entries are case insensitive and ignore both white space and punctuation.
								</p>
								<p>
									<h4 class="section-name">Activity</h4>
										This view contains a log of all of your activity in the Arena.  Additionally, when you recieve messages, they will appear here.  Unread messages will be highlighted in a lighter color.  To mark messages read, simply click on them or on the Mark All Read button in the upper right.  Addtionally, you can filter your view of the activity log by type using the buttons in the upper left.
								</p>
								<p>
									<h4 class="section-name">Info</h4>
										The Info view contains information on how the app works as well as gamemaker contact information and app commands.  You are currently viewing this tab.
								</p>
						</p>

						<p>
							<h3 class="section-name">Earning Fans</h3>
								You will notice when you activate a challenge that a certain number of viewers is monitoring your progress.  Depending on how well you do in each challenge, these viewers may become actual fans of yours.  Of course, you want as many fans as possible as this will help to ensure your victory in the event.  Remember, however, that if you need a hint during a challenge, some of your viewers will become disinterested and stop watching you.  The earlier you take a hint, the more viewers you will lose (see Getting Help).
						</p>

						<p>
							<h3 class="section-name">Getting Help</h3>
								There are two ways in which this app will provide you with help: hints and partial answer responses.
								If you're stuck, get a hint.  But viewers will lose interest, and thus you will lose fans.
								<p>
									<h4 class="section-name">Hints</h4>
										Periodically, hints will become available to you.  A popup will alert you when this happens and a new button will appear in the descriptive panel of the Main view for that challenge.  This button allows you to reveal the hint.  Warning: the earlier you accept the hint the more viewers you will lose.  Eventually, viewers will determine that you've stuck it out long enough.  At this point, none of them will leave if you decide to take a hint (i.e., hints become free eventually).
								</p>
								<p>
									<h4 class="section-name">Partial Answer Responses</h4>
										You can also enter partial answers into the app to see if you are on the right track.  Often times the results of intermediate steps can be checked in this way.  If you are doing the correct thing, the app will let you know.  It is a good idea to check your steps if you're ever unsure.
								</p>
								<p>
									<h4 class="section-name">Contact GC</h4>
										If neither of these options are helpful, you can either ask one of the Piecekeepers on site or you can contact GC at the phone number on the right.  Additionally, you can email GC, though we cannot guarantee a speedy response time if you choose this method.
								</p>
						</p>

						<p>
							<h3 class="section-name">Forfeiting a Challenge</h3>
								In the end, if a challenge is just too daunting (or you're not having fun anymore), you have the option to forfeit that challenge.  To do so, simply enter the code "Save us Thresh!" in the answer box.  If you forfeit, though, none of your viewers will become fans.
						</p>

						<p>
							<h3 class="section-name">Moving the App</h3>
								If your computer ceases to function for some reason, simply move the flash drive with the App to another computer with the same Operating System (OS).  Your progress should be saved and you can resume where you left off.<br><br>If you do not have another computer with the same OS, call GC and will help you out.
